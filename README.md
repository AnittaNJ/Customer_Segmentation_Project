# Customer_Segmentation_Project

# Business Context
You are provided an e-commerce data set from a real-world organisation to perform customer segmentation with clustering models to improve marketing efforts (SAS, 2024). It is a transnational data set with customers from five continents (Oceania, North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia) and 47 countries.

The data set contains 951,668 rows, each representing a product a customer ordered. The data set contains details about the customer (e.g. location, product type, loyalty member) and order (e.g. days to delivery, delivery date, order date, cost, quantity ordered, profit) based on orders between 1 January 2012 and 30 December 2016.

Your task is to develop a robust customer segmentation to assist the e-commerce company in understanding and serving its customers better. This will help to have a more customer-centric focus, improving marketing efficiency. Therefore, youâ€™ll explore the data, employ preprocessing and feature engineering, dimension reduction, and perform customer segmentation with clustering models.

# Objective
Apply statistical and ML methods to perform customer segmentation with clustering techniques.
